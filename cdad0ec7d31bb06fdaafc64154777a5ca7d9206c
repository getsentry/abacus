Here's what I found:\n\n## The Issue\n\nThe `vercel storage create postgres` command no longer works. Vercel has transitioned storage products to the **[Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace)**. This includes:\n- Vercel KV (sunsetted, moved to marketplace)\n- Postgres databases like Neon\n\n## Current Way to Add Neon (2026)\n\n1. Go to **[Vercel Marketplace → Neon](https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon)**\n2. Click **Install**\n3. Choose either:\n   - **Create New Neon Account** - Creates a Neon account for you, billing managed through Vercel\n   - **Link Existing Neon Account** - Connects to your existing Neon database\n4. Select your Vercel project and environments (Production, Preview, Development)\n5. The integration automatically injects `DATABASE_URL` and other connection variables into your project\n\nThe Native Integration also supports **preview branching** - creating isolated database branches for each Vercel Preview Deployment.\n\n## Docs to Update\n\nYour project has two files referencing the old command:\n- `docs/src/content/docs/deployment/vercel.mdx:15`\n- `docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/quick-start.mdx:21`\n\nWould you like me to update these docs to reflect the marketplace approach?\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Vercel Storage Overview](https://vercel.com/docs/storage)\n- [Neon for Vercel – Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon)\n- [Connecting with the Vercel-Managed Integration - Neon Docs](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration)\n- [Install the Neon Postgres Native Integration on Vercel - Neon Docs](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-native-integration)",

Scope is optional. All lines must stay under 100 characters.\n\n## Commit Types\n\n| Type | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `feat` | New feature |\n| `fix` | Bug fix |\n| `ref` | Refactoring (no behavior change) |\n| `perf` | Performance improvement |\n| `docs` | Documentation only |\n| `test` | Test additions or corrections |\n| `build` | Build system or dependencies |\n| `ci` | CI configuration |\n| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |\n| `style` | Code formatting (no logic change) |\n| `meta` | Repository metadata |\n| `license` | License changes |\n\n## Subject Line Rules\n\n- Use imperative, present tense: \"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\"\n- Capitalize the first letter\n- No period at the end\n- Maximum 70 characters\n\n## Body Guidelines\n\n- Explain **what** and **why**, not how\n- Use imperative mood and present tense\n- Include motivation for the change\n- Contrast with previous behavior when relevant\n\n## Footer: Issue References\n\nReference issues in the footer using these patterns:\n\n```\nFixes GH-1234\nFixes #1234\nFixes SENTRY-1234\nRefs LINEAR-ABC-123\n```\n\n- `Fixes` closes the issue when merged\n- `Refs` links without closing\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple fix\n\n```\nfix(api): Handle null response in user endpoint\n\nThe user API could return null for deleted accounts, causing a crash\nin the dashboard. Add null check before accessing user properties.\n\nFixes SENTRY-5678\n```\n\n### Feature with scope\n\n```\nfeat(alerts): Add Slack thread replies for alert updates\n\nWhen an alert is updated or resolved, post a reply to the original\nSlack thread instead of creating a new message. This keeps related\nnotifications grouped together.\n\nRefs GH-1234\n```\n\n### Refactor\n\n```\nref: Extract common validation logic to shared module\n\nMove duplicate validation code from three endpoints into a shared\nvalidator class. No behavior change.\n```\n\n### Breaking change\n\n```\nfeat(api)!: Remove deprecated v1 endpoints\n\nRemove all v1 API endpoints that were deprecated in version 23.1.\nClients should migrate to v2 endpoints.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: v1 endpoints no longer available\nFixes SENTRY-9999\n```\n\n## Revert Format\n\n```\nrevert: feat(api): Add new endpoint\n\nThis reverts commit abc123def456.\n\nReason: Caused performance regression in production.\n```\n\n## Principles\n\n- Each commit should be a single, stable change\n- Commits should be independently reviewable\n- The repository should be in a working state after each commit\n\n## References\n\n- [Sentry Commit Messages](https://develop.sentry.dev/engineering-practices/commit-messages/)\n",
